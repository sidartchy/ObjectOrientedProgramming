Note:
1. We can use constructor in derived class in c++
2. If base class constructor does not have any arguments, there is no need of any constructor
    in derived class
3. But if there are one or more arguments in the base class constructor, derived class need to 
    pass arguments to the base class constructor
4. If both base and derived classes have constructors, base class contructor is executed first.


 

1. In Multiple Inheritance, Base classes are constructed in the order in which they appear
    in class declaration.
2. In Multilevel Inheritance, the constructors are executed in the order of inheritance.



Special Syntax:
    1.C++ supports an special syntax for passing arguments to multiple base classes.
    2.The constructor of the derived class receives all the arguments at once and then will 
        pass the calls to the respective base classes.
    3.The body is called afrer all the constructors are finished executing.

    Syntax:
        Derived-Constructor( arg1, arg2, arg3...) : Base1-constructor(arg1,arg2), Base2-Constructor(arg3,arg4){
            .....
        }Base1-Constructor(arg1, arg2)


Special Case of Virtual Base class
    1. The constructor for Virtual base classes are invoked before an nonvirtual base class
    2. If there are multiple Virtual base classes, they are invoked in the order declared.
    3. Any non-Virtual base class are then constructed before the derived class constructor is executed.
