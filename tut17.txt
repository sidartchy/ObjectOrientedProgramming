// Inheritance in CPP
// Reusability , properties of existing class by inheriting from it, 
// Existing class -->Base class and New class --> Derived class 

/*
    Forms of Inheritance:
    -> Single Inheritance
    -> Multiple Inheritance
    -> Hierarchial Inheritance
    -> Multilevel Inheritance
    -> Hybrid Inheritance
*/

Single Inheritance :
    A Derived class with only one Base class;
    for example:
        (base)Employee --> (derived)Programmer ( a programmer is also an Employee)


Multiple Inheritance:
    A Derived class with more than one base class ;

    for example:

       (base) Employee:(a)--------|
                                  |-----> (derived)Programmer(c)   i.e a+b = c
       (base) Assistant: (b)------|

Hierarchial Inheritance:
    Several derived classes from a single Base class
                            |--->(derived) Manager
    (base) Employee ------->|
                            |--->(derived) Programmer

Multilevel Inheritance:
    Deriving a class from already derived class

    (base) Animal  ---> (derived) Mammal-----> (derived) Cow

Hybrid Inheritance:
    A combination fo Multiple Inheritance and Multilevel Inheritance
    A class is derived from two classes as in Multiple Inheritance
    however , one of the parent classes is not a base class
    example:

        |---->b---------|                   a = Animal
    a--_|               | --> d             b= Mammal , c = Bird
        |---->c---------|                   d = Bat

//Derived Class syntax
/*
class {{derived class-name}} : {{visibility mode}}   {{base class name}}
{
    class members/methods etc...
}

Note:
1. Default visibility mode is private.
2. Private visibility mode: Public members of the base class becomes private members of the derived class
3. Public visibility mode: Public members of the base class becomes public members of the derived class
4. Private members are never inherited.
